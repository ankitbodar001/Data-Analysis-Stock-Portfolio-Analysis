# Stock Market Analysis and Portfolio Optimization

This project analyzes stock market performance and optimizes a portfolio using Python. It employs data visualization, statistical analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations to provide insights and optimal asset allocation.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Automated stock data retrieval using `yfinance`.
- **Visualization**: Line plots, histograms, and heatmaps for trends, distributions, and correlations.
- **Moving Averages**: 50-day and 200-day moving averages to identify long-term trends.
- **Daily Returns Analysis**: Computation of daily returns and their statistical distributions.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Efficient frontier generation and Sharpe ratio maximization.

## Technologies Used

- Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `yfinance`
- Statistical tools: Daily return distributions and correlation matrices
- Monte Carlo simulations: Portfolio optimization using risk-return metrics

## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
2. Run the script in a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
3. View the generated plots and portfolio optimization results.
